Use NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB to do the following 


1. An API that takes a CSV file from a multipart form upload 
2. The uploaded CSV file gets scanned and its contents are pushed to a MongoDB collection 
3. Write another API to perform CRUD operations over the collection 
4. Every route should have a middleware that checks for a very basic authentication token (something like "allow" or "deny", you can use passport as well for this if you want) 


Things to verify 
* Make sure to use an ODM/ORM 
* The CSV file can be in any format you want 
* Make sure to create a Postman collection of the APIs What we will look for 
* Structure of the APIs 
* Code structure 
* Documenting the steps to properly start and stop the server
